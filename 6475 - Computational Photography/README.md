	• Steps to Refresh the Git folders:
		1. For my Github Repo need to run a git pull - so change the directory to:  /c/Users/dmar79/assignments.git/OMSCS6475_assigments . Then run a git pull
		2. For My Desktop folder location need to run a git pull  - so change the directory to: /c/Users/dmar79/Desktop/"My Stuff"/"GT OMSCS"/"6475 - Computational Photography"/"Git Repo"/OMSCS6475_lab_exercises . then run the git pull
	
    Run the following command:
    conda install -c https://conda.binstar.org/menpo opencv
    I realized that opencv3 is also available now, run the following command:
    conda install -c https://conda.binstar.org/menpo opencv3
    Edit on Aug 18, 2016: You may like to add the "menpo" channel permanently by:
    conda config --add channels menpo
    And then opencv can be installed by:
    conda install opencv (or opencv3)
    Edit on Aug 14, 2017: "clinicalgraphics" channel provides relatively newer vtk version for very recent python3
    conda install -c clinicalgraphics vtk
