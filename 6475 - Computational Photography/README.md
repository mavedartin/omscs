```	
 Run the following command:
    conda install -c https://conda.binstar.org/menpo opencv
    I realized that opencv3 is also available now, run the following command:
    conda install -c https://conda.binstar.org/menpo opencv3
    Edit on Aug 18, 2016: You may like to add the "menpo" channel permanently by:
    conda config --add channels menpo
    And then opencv can be installed by:
    conda install opencv (or opencv3)
    Edit on Aug 14, 2017: "clinicalgraphics" channel provides relatively newer vtk version for very recent python3
    conda install -c clinicalgraphics vtk
```
